2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell MAIS_reg[0]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) MAIS_reg[0]/PRE, MAIS_reg[3]/PRE, MAIS_reg[4]/PRE, MAIS_reg[5]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell MAIS_reg[1]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) MAIS_reg[1]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell MAIS_reg[2]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) MAIS_reg[6]/CLR, MAIS_reg[2]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell MENOS_reg[0]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) MENOS_reg[0]/CLR, MENOS_reg[3]/CLR, MENOS_reg[4]/CLR, MENOS_reg[5]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#5 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell MENOS_reg[1]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) MENOS_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#6 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell MENOS_reg[2]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) MENOS_reg[2]/CLR, MENOS_reg[6]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
